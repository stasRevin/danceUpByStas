### Week 0
09/03/2018

Tasks Completed:
* Chose a project goal

* Started Time Log
* Completed Application Flow for individual project
* Started ERD Design for individual project
* Completed all week 1 activities
* Completed Exercise 1

Found a nice example of Tomcat security realm implementation [here](https://www.avajava.com/tutorials/lessons/how-do-i-use-a-jdbc-realm-with-tomcat-and-mysql.html?page=3):
